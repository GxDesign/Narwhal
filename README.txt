# BeenVerified Code Challenge:

For the challenge, I used jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3 and Font Awesome (and also my sense of humor :]). 

I created all of the graphic assets from scratch on Photoshop and Illustrator with the exception of the footer texture which I got from SubtlePatterns.com. 
I chose to leave out Bootstrap's Javascript files so that I can code a few things by hand. 

Two not so obvious features of the page are a responsive navbar with two states for the dropdown - one for when the page is at the very top (offset of 0) and one for the when the user has scrolled before clicking - and form validation in the footer with dynamic messages. 


I had plenty of fun with this challenge and I really hope you enjoy it as well!
